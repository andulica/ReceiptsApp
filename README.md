## ReceiptX
Sick of keeping records of your receipts and manage expenses? Well there is a solution to everything and ReceiptX adresses this issue by using ML models special trained for this type of operations, Google Cloud Vision API and some refined Regex patterns to extract all the relevant information from your receipt and categorise your expenses. All you need to do is take a photo of your receipt and upload it on the app and let it handle all the hassle for you.

- See stats about your expenses. This feature is not yet fully implemented as it is at about 80% ready. All is left to do is creating the refined regex patterns which will serve  as the last filter regarding the refining of data extracted from receipts.

## üöß Future features 

### High view of some of the future features

- Display the stores on a map using Google Maps API from where clients made the most recent purchases and suggestions of other relevant stores in the area.
- Allowing client to make a list with the products that he wants to buy and suggest them the most appropiate store based on the total price of the products.
- Keeping records of the recycle labelled bottles and inform them with the total value that they can redeem if they recycle them.
- Display a map with all the recycle centers around the area that they live in.
- Give notification related to price increases or decreases based on the most recent entries of similar products that they usually buy.

### More granular future features

- Allowing users to create their own category of products and move relevant items from different categories on the newly created one.
- Allowing users to help the system better decide where a certain product goes by manually introducing the criteria and the details in a pop window when the system is not being able to categorise the product.
- Automate the trainning of ML models by doing it on a daily basis with the new data as the number of users grows and more data is available and by doing so the accuracy of results can increase naturally.
- Add 3rd party authentication methods such as Google, Facebook and Email.
- Improve security against XSS attacks and better manage JWT tokens by adding extra steps of security such as JWT refresh token.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

You can download the zip file from this repository and just run it on visual studio. 
--IMPORTANT POINT! You won't be able to access the dasboard section and neither the login because the database connection string will most probably be on azure secrets once deployed. My suggestion is to create an in memory data base, change the connection string in the Program.cs and run a migration from the respective folder. Bear in mind that data will be deleted once the app is closed. If you prefer data persistance build a local SQL Server database and you are good to go.
- Also if you really want to work on the backend services I can give full access to Google Cloud Vision API key.
